# Assignment04: Persona + Scenerio 
### DH110, Joie Cao

## Intro
My PC building app/website is aimed at helping new and inexperienced users learn and customize their own PC. For this assignment, I will be analyzing 2 friends who both share the need for a new PC, however their goals and desired features are completely different. 

## 2 Features to Proposal
First, I want to implement an easy tutorial system for new users to learn the technical vocabulary to PC building. The tutorial should be skippable, so that experienced users will not need to waste their time. The tutorial section should include short text descriptions of PC parts, and at the end it will direct the user to a library of videos and additional help. It should take around 10-14 minutes to complete, and once it is done the user can proceed to the rest of the app/site. Alternatively, short blurbs about PC components can appear as popups as the user is exploring the app/site. Again, experienced users will have the option to turn this feature off. 

Another feature I would like to try is a customization tool. Today, customization tools are extremely popular, especially for tech, shoes, and cars. For example, Adidas' website shows a 3D turnaround of the shoe you are creating. When you change the fabric pattern, you can see it reflected in the model. Since PC parts are so different, it would be impossible to create a 1 to 1 version of this feature. However, I want to create a tool that will help users roughly visualize the lights and colors in their build, perhaps something along the lines of PC Part Picker. Users have a checklist of core parts they need. Once they choose a part, it will be added to a blank image of a PC like adding a piece to a puzzle. I want to make the PC building experience feel like building a Lego set.
